Min_support = .01 and min_confidence = .5 left me with 15 rules, which is a manageable number to work with but isn't too small.) Each of these rules suggested an association with either whole milk or \"other vegetables\". There are 10 other items which show up in these frequent itemsets (whipped/sour cream, yogurt, domestic eggs, curd, butter, rolls/buns, root vegetables, citrus fruit, tropical fruit, pip fruit). (I hadn't heard of pip fruit before. Apparently it refers to fruit with a core and seeds arranged in pairs, like apples or pears.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly all of these items are staples, and some are broad categories (root vegetables, other vegetables). In that regard, these rules are not particularly interesting in themselves. They do, however, suggest a few areas of a store which many customers are very likely to visit. The store might benefit from placing flashy, impulse-buy-type items near the whole milk, or the produce section. (For example: cookie dough, bottled smoothies, or other prepared foods.) Alternately, you might arrange your store so that produce and dairy are far away from each other, meaning that customers will have to walk through a larger portion of the store and see (and possibly buy) a wider variety of items. This does appear to be common practice in grocery stores, in my experience. At the grocery store near where I grew up, for example, the milk is in the very back of the store; to get there, you would pass by beer & wine, the bakery section, or Panda Express, depending on your chosen route. Any of these might entice you to spend just a bit more than you planned."
